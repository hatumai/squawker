WTF
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Squawker fills a serious need among the socially inept, how to
belong to the tweetosphere while maintaining my social isolation.

Squawker could also be useful for some other commercial stuff, 
that is why it is licensed under the Creative Commons -

If you want to use this for NonCommercial use, go for it.  For
Commercial use, you have to contact me to get proper licensing.

Nothing is more awesome that automating your social interaction.

The goal is for this application to be as self contained as
possible.  Sinatra, Twitter and YAML are required.

I have tested it with Ruby 1.9.2, but it may well work with
other versions.
